<p>This place’s name are not particularly imaginative but its setting–not far from the sea shore in the shadow of the Rushikonda hill–certainly is. Started in 1988 by Mr. Venkatapathy Raju, originally from Guntur.</p>



<p>Lakshmi Devi Kakarlapudi, Chef and wife of Venkatapathy Raju – A native of Guntur, Devi learned the art of cooking from her mother. She spent countless hours in the kitchen watching, learning and helping to prepare meals for her family. Since all her recipes are those that have been handed down for generations, Sea Inn is The place for foodies to try traditional home cooked Andhra Non Veg dishes.</p>



<p>The couple have been successfully running Sea Inn for 28 years now, Vizag’s foodies who don’t mind the 15-km drive along the coast to the little restaurant. Must Try: Chicken Biryani and Liver Fry.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>It’s almost too good to be true: a rustic palm-thatched shack, run by a mom-and-pop team</h4>



<p>When the Vizag Municipality wanted to close down the Raju Gari Dhaba for some supposed infraction some years ago, the citizens of Vizag congregated outside the Muni­cipal office to protest, and the decision was quietly reversed. Now that’s what you call ‘by public demand’.</p>



<p>The dhaba is right on the beach, 15 km outside town, hidden off the Bhimli road. It’s almost too good to be true: a rustic palm-thatched shack, run by a mom-and-pop team, Mr and Mrs K.V. Raju (she cooks, he mana­ges) and it specialises in home-cooked Andhra dis­hes, which she learned from her grandmother. The official name is Sea Inn, but everybody simply calls it Raju Gari Dhaba, after the proprietor. It’s set under the palm trees, within range of the ocean spray, and the menu is as minimalistic as the surroundings: just about a dozen dishes for the day, scribbled on a whiteboard. It says that the house specialities are country chicken and mutton keema, but ignore that. The thing to order is their fresh prawns, crab or fish (salt-water or sweet-water), all cooked with a typical Andhra zing. We pondered over the choice of fish—vanjiram or chandua, both fresh from the nearby fish market— and finally settled on a vanjiram curry, fried chandua, and a huge crab in a thick, fiery gravy, with steaming rice. And as we licked our fingers, we understood why the good people of Vizag protested its closure. We’d have protested, too.</p>
